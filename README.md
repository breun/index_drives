# index_drives

A Bash script to create an index of all files and directories on mounted drives, including metadata. Having this information can be useful when you don't know on what external drive a specific file is stored, or when trying to recover files from a damaged drive. This script is setup for use and tested on macOS, but I believe that by adapting the default configuration values it could also work on other platforms.

## Setup

1. Download the script:

```bash
curl https://github.com/breun/index_drives/raw/master/index_drives.sh
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x index_drives.sh
```

3. Edit the configuration section of the script using a text editor.
- `INDEX_ROOT`: The location where drives to index are mounted. By default this is `/Volumes`, which is the standard location for macOS.
- `EXCLUDED_DRIVES`: You can exclude any drives you donâ€™t want indexed, like for instance your internal drives and backup drives. By default the following drive names are excluded from indexing:
  - `Macintosh HD`
  - `Time Machine`
  - `com.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots`
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: You can specify where you want the index files to be stored. By default these files are stored in a folder called `External Drive indices` in your home directory. The output directory will automatically be created if it doesn't exist yet.

## Index

After setting up, you can execute the script:

```bash
./index_drives.sh
```

Any existing files for previously indexed drives will be overwritten with the current state of affairs. Any existing files for previously indexed, but currently not connected drives will remain untouched.
